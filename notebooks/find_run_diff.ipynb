The script will take the two folders, regex's to make them comparable (by using the capture groups to make a shared key). It will then create an output file of set name with a list of `key\\tfolder` pairs for runs that exist in the first but not the second. Comments for these files will be added with a `#` for parsing purposes.\n",
